X299 EFI Archive for Asus X299 Deluxe II Motherboard and 9940X CPU. 

### Intel WiFi + BT
The X299-Deluxe II Board comes with the Intel 9260 WiFi + Bluetooth chipset onboard. As of [cebf93a](https://github.com/dezinezync/X299-EFI-Folder-Distributions/tree/16521f2e683024fcb4ce11f64fa0ea841cebf93a), I've switched to this as it's proven to be more reliable than my many years old Broadcom WiFi chipset. I'll be looking into getting a chip in there with BT5.1 and WiFi6 support once that becomes available.
